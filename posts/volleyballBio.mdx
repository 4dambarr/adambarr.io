Those who know me personally know how important the role volleyball plays in my life, I have dedicated countless days to training, playing, and organising. I truly love the sport and think it everyone should give it a go, and not just because it would give me an ego boost beating more people!

After graduating from university and [starting my jobs as a software engineer](/blog/post/lessons-from-my-first-months), I have been looking for ways to volunteer and have a meaningful impact on the world outside of my job. When the opportunity to become a delivery group lead for Volleyball England arose I knew it was something I wanted to do.

After applying and interviewing, I am thrilled to share that I have been provisionally recommended to the board to become the Delivery Lead for Volleyball England’s Clubs and Networks subgroup! I still have a lot to learn about what to position involves, but I am excited to use it to improve the game of volleyball in England.

Since finding out I was recommended to the board, I have had to write a personal bio explaining my motivation for the role and why I think I would be a good fit. It was a strange experience writing in the third person, and difficult to try and fit all of my volleyball experience into one easily consumable bio, but I am pleased with the result and wanted to share it on this blog.

So here is a biography of my motivations for taking the role of Delivery Group Lead for Volleyball Enlgand's Clubs and Networks subgroup, written by me, in the third person:

When asked how he got into playing volleyball, Adam often replies that he was “lucky” to attend a high school where volleyball was taken seriously, “lucky” that the school had a strong connection to the local volleyball club, and “lucky” that the club had high performing teams and talented coaches. This luck allowed Adam to compete at a National Level, experience promotions and relegations, make countless new friends, become a qualified referee, and develop into a better volleyball player and a confident and outgoing person.

Adam doesn’t think these opportunities should be so dependent on luck, he hopes that as the Delivery Lead for Clubs and Networks, he can help provide more people with the opportunity to experience what he credits to his personal growth and success.

Adam started playing volleyball at age 11 with Newcastle Staffs Volleyball Club, he went on to play in multiple National Junior Competitions with the club, as well as inter-regional competitions with West Midlands. He made his National Volleyball League debut with Newcastle Staffs aged 16.

After completing his A-Levels Adam began studying at the University of York, where he spent time playing for and as captain of the University’s 1st team and York Vikings. Adam was elected President of the University Volleyball Club in his final year at York, as president he helped raise over £4000 for the club and organised its first international tour, all whilst over 200 students played volleyball in different club activities. This contribution to volleyball at York was recognised when Adam was nominated for Yorkshire BUCS Region Volunteer of the Year.

Upon graduating from York, Adam moved to London, starting a job as a Software Engineer and joining the London Giants Men's 1st team. Adam competed in National League Division 1 and the London Premier League with Giants, enjoying Super League promotion and winning the London Premier League.

Adam hopes his experience of English Volleyball and passion for the sport can benefit volleyball players nationwide, regardless of if they have years of competitive experience or just want to try out a new sport. His Master's degree in Computer Science also gives him a wealth of knowledge to understand where technology can empower clubs and players and where it can be a burden.

He hopes that by contributing his knowledge and energy to the Get Keep Grow subgroup, he can help strengthen the English volleyball club structure, improve the quality of volleyball in the country, and help more people discover the life changing experiences available through volleyball.
