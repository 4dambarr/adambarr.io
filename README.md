# adambarr.io

Repository containing code for the personal website of Adam Barr, the deployed site can be found add [adambarr.io](https://adambarr.io)

## About

[adambarr.io](https://adambarr.io) is my personal website, it is build using NextJS and statically hosted on Cloudflare pages.

## Updating contents of the site

Almost all the contents in the site can be easily updated without code, whilst some JSON object still need organising 

To publish a new blog, all you have to do is create a new MDX file in the 'Posts' folder and include the necessary front matter, to update my experience you just need to update the contents of the list experience list.

## Future work

I plan to regularly add new features and section to this site, here are some of my ideas:
- Publishing blogs will publish updates to an RSS feed
- Add Light/Dark mode with a toggle
- Update the animation of the book carousel to be smoother

## Running locally

As with most NextJS projects, this site can be run locally by pulling the repository, run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`
